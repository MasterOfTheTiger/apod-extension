Web extension to show the latest Astronomy Picture of the Day

## What I have done
I have completely changed the extension, the only thing that is the same is the icons. Here are some of the things I have done:

- Sorting through images
- Manually entering dates
- W3.css
- Footer

## Contributing
If you want to help, please do. I don't know how to use GitHub very well. So it would be great.

## Added Since 1.2.2
These are things that I have uploaded since I released version 1.2.2.
- Removed image borders
- Added link to image
- Changed + added hover notes
- Made back button go to last viewed picture instead of today's
- Added a lot of comments in JS code
- Added "Check Internet Connection" message when loading for more than 5 seconds.
- Styled date box
