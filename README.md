# apod-extension
Web extension to show the latest Astronomy Picture of the Day.

Features:
- View the astronomy picture of the day with a click of a button
- View previous pictures with an easy switcher
- Share pictures via email, Facebook, or Twitter

[Get it for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/astronomy-picture/?src=userprofile). 

No Chrome extension is available because I do not have a Chrome webstore developer account.
